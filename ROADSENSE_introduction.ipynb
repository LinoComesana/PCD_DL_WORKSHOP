    "# 3. ROADSENSE introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the basics of point cloud simulation from scratch with python, let's move to the last part of the 1st block, which consists in a brief introduction to the **ROADSENSE simulator**: https://github.com/GeoTechUVigo/ROADSENSE\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/roadsense_github.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 800px;\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "**ROADSENSE** is a simulation software that allows the generation of synthetic point clouds datasets within **different transportation systems and forestry scenarios**. It was published alongside a case study in https://doi.org/10.3390/infrastructures9030058, where different experiments were carried with a DL model, PointNet++ (which will be used in the next section of this course) and compared with the results retrieved when departing from synthetic data from other state-of-the-art simulator HELIOS++.\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated before, ROADSENSE allows the generation of synthetic point clouds in both forested regions as well as places partially covered with vegetation where different types of roads coexist.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/nubes_sinteticas.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 800px;\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology followed by ROADSENSE during the generation protocols is quite similar to the one presented in the previous section. For example, in case of forest scenarios without road presence, the process can be sorted as follows: **generation of the Digital Terrain Model (DTM)**, **generation of modified tree segments** and, finally, **merge of the semantic information in a single point cloud**. However, the case of transportation scenes requires the implementation of new 3D designs concerning human-made elements, like barriers, traffic signals or even natural elements like slopes and their surrounding vegetation.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    - road_type (index 3): This indicates the type of road to simulate. Options: “highway”, “national”, “local”, or “mixed”. If the “mixed” option is selected, the resulting point cloud dataset will consist of a mix of different types of roads.\n",
